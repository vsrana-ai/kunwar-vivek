## About me

Vivek hails from [India](https://www.incredibleindia.org/content/incredible-india-v2/en.html) and is a NLP Enthusiast. He is presently working as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Researcher with the University of Cagliari, Italy and Philips Research, Netherlands for PhilHumans (European Commission, Horizon 2020, ITN project). Prior to this, he was working as a Research Engineer for the project "Search for Hidden Particle" (SHiP) of the European Commission of Nuclear Research (CERN) at NUST-MiSiS. He has also rendered his services to the "Embassy of India in Moscow" to Education and Defense sector for strengthening Indo-Russian bilateral relations. He received his MS degree from NUST-MiSiS in Computer Science.

## Short bio

#I got the B.Sc. (2014) and M.Sc. (2016) degrees in Computer Science at University of Cagliari. In 2020, I received my Ph.D. from the the same University.

#My B.Sc. thesis treats mobile payment technologies and recommendation systems to improve business revenues between costumers and sellers. For my Master Thesis, I worked at a regional project of the Sardinia government named *Rete Natura 2000: Valutazione dei piani di gestione e studio dei corridoi ecologici come rete complessa*. The Thesis, titled *A Complex Network approach to evaluate the Natura 2000 network*, shows an analysis of the network on the regional land to support enviromental regional planners. My Ph.D. dissertation *Knowledge Extraction from Textual Resources through Semantic Web Tools and Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms for Applications in Various Domains* describes the use of Artificial Intelligence components to manipulate text data for the extraction of knowledge in the Healthcare, E-learning, Scholarly, and Biologiocal domains.

From Academic Year 2015/2016 to 2018/2019 I was academic tutor of the Computer Architecture course of the B.Sc. degree in Computer Science at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Cagliari.

#From June to September 2016, I was in Eindhoven (The Netherlands) for an internship at Data Science Department of Philips Research under the supervision of [Sergio Consoli](http://stlab.istc.cnr.it/stlab/staff/sergio-consoli/). With Dr. Sergio Consoli, I explored the IBM Watson framework for experimenting its applications on the Healthcare domain.

#From October 2016 to October 2019, I was Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Cagliari supervised by the Professor [Diego Reforgiato](http://people.unica.it/diegoreforgiato/). My research activity mainly focuses on Machine Learning and Semantic Web technologies. I defended my thesis on Febraury 26, 2020.

#During my Ph.D. studies, I had the opportunity to visit many research centers around the world. I was visiting student for 3 months in fall 2017 of the Professor [Dennis Shasha](https://cs.nyu.edu/shasha/) at the Center for Data Science of the New York University. With the team of Professor Shasha, we developed a tool called Supernoder aimed at simplifying the search of patterns on biological networks.

#I was also visiting student of the Professor [Enrico Motta](http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk/motta/) at the Knowledge Media Institute of the Open University from September to December 2018. From January 2019 to April 2019, I was visiting student at the LIPN in Paris under the supervision of Professor [Davide Buscaldi](https://sites.google.com/site/davidebuscaldi/). During these periods, I worked on text mining techniques that exploit both Machine Learning and Semantic Web technologies for extracting knowledge from scientific literature in order to build a scientific knowledge graph. 

Currently, I am working as PostDoc / Senior Researcher at [FIZ Karlsruhe](https://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/) within the [FIZ ISE](https://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/en/forschung/information-service-engineering) team with the Professor [Harald Sack](https://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/en/forschung/lebenslauf-prof-dr-harald-sack).
